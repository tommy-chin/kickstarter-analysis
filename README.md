# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
A client was interested in understanding how different Kickstarter campaigns performed based on their launch dates and funding goals. Based on the Kickstarter data that was analyzed, this analysis demonstrates how the launch date and the funding goal may be correlated to success, failure, and cancelation numbers of Kickstarter projects. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This chart shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled theatre outcomes based on launch date. 
### Outcomes Based on Goals

This chart shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarter outcomes based on the funding goal that was set. 
### Challenges
There were no challenges or difficulties that were encountered when performing the analysis on the data. A possible problem that could have occurred would have been if there were not many theater Kickstarters to do an analysis on. This would have led to an analysis based on a small sample size which could have led to an inaccurate analysis. 
 
## Results 
#### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates Results
From the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, it was found that Kickstarters that started in the month of May had the greatest number of successful outcomes. Kickstarters that started in the month of December had the least number of successful outcomes.
#### Outcomes Based on Goals Results
From the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, it was determined that Kickstarters that had funding goals of between $35,000 to $44,999 seemed to have a very high success percentage. Funding goals of $45,000 and over had a drastic drop in success percentage. 
#### Analysis Limitations
It is possible that launch date and funding goals are not the only variables that could lead to different outcome numbers. The dataset that was analyzed had no information on whether or not the Kickstarters offered any incentives. Kickstarters often provide incentives to those who help towards a funding goal. It is possible that those Kickstarters that had funding goals of over $45,000 simply gave no incentives for funding and only offered the final product if the goal was met which could be why their failure rates were higher. On the other hand, those Kickstarters with funding goals from $35,000 to $44,999 may have given incentives that would motivate backers to contribute more to the funding goal which would lead to the success of the Kickstart projects. Further analysis on the success, failure, and cancelation outcomes against whether or not incentives were given to Kickstarter backers could give a greater picture to the contribution of incentives to these outcomes.
