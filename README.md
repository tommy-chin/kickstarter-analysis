# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
A client was interested in understanding how different Kickstarter campaigns performed based on their launch dates and funding goals. Based on the Kickstarter data that was analyzed, this analysis demonstrates how the launch date and the funding goal may be correlated to success, failure, and cancelation numbers of Kickstarter projects. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This chart shows the number of successful, failed, and canceled theatre outcomes based on launch date. 
### Outcomes Based on Goals

This chart shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter outcomes based on the funding goal that was set. 
### Challenges
There were no challenges or difficulties that were encountered when performing the analysis on the data. However, it is possible that launch date and funding goals are not the only variables that could lead to different outcome numbers. Kickstarters often provide incentives to those who help towards a funding goal. Through the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, it is shown that funding goals from $35,000 to $44,999 have a great success rate but that success rate drops drastically once approaching the $45,000 and above range. It is possible that those Kickstarters that had funding goals of over $45,000 simply gave no incentives for funding and only offered the final product if the goal was met. On the other hand, it is also possible that those with funding goals from $35,000 to $44,999 gave incentives that would motivate backers to contribute more to the funding goal which would lead to the success of the Kickstart projects.
 
## Results 
From the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, it was able to be determined that Kickstarters that started in the month of May had the greatest number of successful outcomes. Theatre Kickstarters also seem to have a great successful vs failure ratio with
